## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of cats, dogs, and snakes. The model was trained using a dataset sourced from Kaggle and is deployed using Gradio for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the [Animal Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borhanitrash/animal-image-classification-dataset). It contains images of various animals categorized into different classes.

## Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and dense layers, with ReLU activation functions. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to classify the images into three categories.

## Results
The model was trained for 30 epochs and evaluated on a test dataset. It achieved a reasonable accuracy for the classification task.
